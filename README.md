# Breast Cancer Causality_Challenge

* The features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.

<h2>Data Attributes</h2>

* ID number
* Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign)

**Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:**

* radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
* texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
* perimeter
* area
* smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
* compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
* concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
* concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
* symmetry
* fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)

The mean, standard error and "worst" or largest (mean of the three largest values) of these features were computed for each image
